    This page helps new and prospective members by demystifying cycling clubs, explaining the Condors' ethos, and
    answering a few of those questions you were afraid to ask. For the majority of our members, joining the Condors was
    their first experience of being part of a cycling club. And for the vast majority, the prospect was nerve-wracking!
    Most people, even those who've owned a road bike for years and done a lot of miles, have doubts about whether
    they'll be quick enough, or have the bike handling skills to ride in a group.
